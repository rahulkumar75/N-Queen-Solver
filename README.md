# N-Queens-Solver
This project is an advanced implementation of the N-Queens problem solver.
The N-Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This application finds all possible solutions for a given number of queens and visually represents each solution on a dynamically generated chessboard.

# Features
* Dynamic User Input: Enter the number of queens to find solutions for any size of N.
* Visual Representation: Solutions are displayed on an interactive chessboard with highlighted queens.
* Pagination: Easily navigate through multiple solutions using pagination controls.
* Interactive UI: User-friendly interface with responsive design and interactive elements.
* No External Libraries: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation.

# Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
  * git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/N-Queens-Solver.git](https://github.com/rahulkumar75/N-Queens-Solver.git)
2. Open index.html in your browser to see the application in action.

# Project Structure
* index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
* styles.css: The CSS file for styling the web page.
* script.js: The JavaScript file containing the logic for solving the N-Queens problem and rendering the solutions.
* queen.png: The image used to represent the queen on the chessboard.

# How It Works
* Input: Enter the number of queens in the input field and click the "Generate Solution" button.
* Solve: The algorithm finds all valid solutions where no two queens can attack each other.
* Display: Solutions are displayed on a chessboard with pagination controls to navigate through them.
